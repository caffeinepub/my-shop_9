  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-11 by updating the shop name from 'Dondon's Core' to 'Dondon's little luxuries' across the frontend. The browser tab title in index.html, the header logo in Layout.tsx (now using a logo image with appropriate alt text), the footer branding in Layout.tsx, and the hero text in ProductsPage.tsx all reflect the new name. The logo image file is referenced as expected. No color, font, spacing, or layout changes are apparent from the diff.",
